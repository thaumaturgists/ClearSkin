# Chapter 1: Introduction

[Empathy and Localization](https://github.com/thaumaturgists/subcortical)

## Empathy and Localization
The book is made from empathy, focusing on the localization of saving the world while working independently. It emphasizes that the organization is not solely about saving the world alone, but rather acknowledges the possibility that it could.

# Subcortical

## Under the bark
Inadvertently, the project I am working on has been underway since 2016, 2017–2018, 2019–2021 reformation, and the book itself from 2021 to the present.  
Even if it's a mess, it's my mentality that keeps me from acting or moving, and when I do, it's because I want a better world.  
I tried to determine the boundaries of wrongdoing in the world in 2019. It was limitless, and the deed even brought unnecessary attention to me in a hidden world.  
Who knew what the actual world was like? The longer I maintained my composure and endured the mocking pain, the more absurd it got.  
I discovered that, like a shadow, there were others who wanted every miracle I performed to be a lie.

### Truth
No sin is ever new, and that is the limit of sin.  
Since I am the only one who truly knows my thoughts and actions, I shall use myself as the truth in the world. I used my personal information as an anchor.  
Since I write constantly and could do so indefinitely, I have not yet rotated the content to my liking in the majority of cases.  
Together, let's create something lovely.
